dsa-inventory-project
=====================

Team Project for ESC DSA Course Fall 2014

To compile and run the program, navigate to the src directory and execute the 
command javac inventory/NamesOfFiles.java. This will compile all files in the
"inventory" package (provided you actually list all the source files you want
to compile or a wildcard character to compile all of them).

To then run the program, execute the command java inventory.InventoryApp.

Currently, InventoryApp has been tested with ItemArray as the container class
for ItemRecord using the data.csv file, with 5000 inventory records.
